# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

##  Overview

This Healthcare Analytics Dashboard provides insights into patient health metrics, risk factors, and demographic distributions. It helps in identifying trends related to heart disease, stroke, overweight categories, and health risks.

##  Features

**Key Metrics:** Total patients, high-risk patients, high-risk smokers.

**Demographic Analysis:** Distribution by Age Group, Race, and Gender.

**Health Risk Assessment:** Breakdown of patients by risk level (Normal, Moderate, High, Critical).

**Disease Cases (%):** Stroke and Heart Attack cases represented with pie charts.

**Weight & Overweight Category Analysis:** Treemap for Average Weight by Overweight Category (Filtered to show only Male and Female Overweight).

**Interactive Elements:** Gender and BMI slicers.

##  Key Insights

**1.** Majority of patients fall under the Normal or Moderate Health Risk categories.

**2.** Chinese patients have the highest number of overweight cases.

**3.** Most stroke and heart attack cases occur in the **50-69** age group.

**4.** High-risk smoking is relatively low, but should still be monitored.

**5.** Female overweight patients have a lower average weight compared to male overweight patients.

##  Recommendations

**Targeted Intervention for Overweight Chinese Patients:** Given the high number of overweight cases among Chinese patients, community-based health programs and diet workshops can be introduced.

**Age-Specific Preventive Measures:** Since most stroke and heart attack cases occur in the 50-69 age group, regular health check-ups and lifestyle modification programs should be encouraged for this demographic.

**Enhanced Screening for High-Risk Groups:** Patients classified as moderate to high risk should undergo more frequent screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes to prevent severe health conditions.

**Personalized Weight Management Plans:** Since female overweight patients have a lower average weight than male overweight patients, customized health plans should consider gender-specific dietary and fitness recommendations.
